# CLAUDE.md

Task Activity Manager (TAM) is the agile task-management app of the suite:
Jira DC tasks, epics, stories, bugs, and requirements for scrum masters,
product owners, and team members. It shares connection profiles and the
Windows Credential Manager entries with Xray Test Manager through
`core/profile` and the shared `profiles.db`. The design lives in
`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-04-tam-foundation-design.md`; the Outline
collection "Task Activity Manager" mirrors it.

## Status

Foundation scaffold (plan 0b): the shell, the Profiles dialog, and
placeholder views. Phase 1 adds issue sync and the Backlog.

## Layout

    main.go              Wails entry point, window, menu
    app.go               App struct: validates and delegates, nothing more
    internal/tamstore/   TAM's own SQLite file (schema version 1, no app tables yet)
    internal/suiteprofiles/  which shared profiles TAM shows, demo detection, validation
    frontend/            React app on @agile-suite/core (see ../frontend/core)
      src/api.ts         re-exports the generated bindings, defines plain shapes
      wailsjs/           GENERATED bindings, do not hand-edit

## Commands

    wails dev                      # run with hot reload
    wails build                    # build/bin/task-activity-manager.exe
    go test ./internal/...         # Go tests
    cd frontend; npx vitest run    # frontend tests
    cd frontend; npm run build     # tsc + vite build

`npm install` runs at the repo root (npm workspaces). `frontend:install` in
wails.json does that for you.

## Conventions

Same as XTM's: logic in `internal/`, `app.go` only adapts it to Wails; Jira
is the system of record; credentials go to the OS credential manager only;
`TODO(tam): desc` marks planned work. Profiles TAM creates carry backend
`jira`; Kiwi profiles from XTM are hidden. UI text uses no em dashes.
